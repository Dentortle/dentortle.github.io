const cases = [
{ answer: "Attrition", clues: ["An 82-year-old male presents complaining of generalized loss of incisal and occlusal tooth structure.", "Physical examination shows that both the tooth structure and existing restorations (e.g., amalgam) are evenly worn down.", "Radiographically, the slow loss of structure has allowed for dentin to be synthesized over the pulpal surface.", "Histology would show loss of tooth structure caused by tooth-to-tooth contact during occlusion and mastication.", "The patient reports a history of chronic grinding habits or premature contacts.", "The process is typically asymptomatic, and pulp exposure or sensitivity is rare due to the slow progression."] },
{answer:"Erosion",clues:["The patient presents complaining of sensitivity, which is primarily located on the lingual surfaces of maxillary anterior teeth.","Involvement of the posterior teeth is noted on the occlusal surfaces.","Radiographs of posterior teeth show that the edges of metallic restorations are elevated above the level of the tooth structure.","Histopathology reveals a loss of tooth structure caused by a chemical process, likely due to chronic regurgitation.","An environmental factor, such as exposure to acid found in foods, drinks, or medications, is generally implicated.","This form of tooth wear is classified as a pathological process."]},
{answer:"Abrasion",clues:["A patient presents with localized loss of tooth structure in the cervical region opposite their dominant hand.","Physical exam reveals V-shaped notches near the cementoenamel junction.","Radiographs show a distinct loss of structure secondary to the action of an external agent.","Histology is defined by pathologic loss of tooth structure, generally caused by an external agent such as aggressive toothbrushing or holding pipe stems.","The patient is asymptomatic, as pulp exposure and dentin sensitivity are rare.","Treatment usually involves identifying and eliminating the external causal agent."]},
{answer:"Hyperdontia (Mesiodens)",clues:["A 15-year-old male is undergoing orthodontic evaluation and is noted to have an extra tooth.","Clinically, this supernumerary tooth is located in the maxillary anterior incisor region.","Radiographs confirm the presence of a single, extra permanent tooth.","Histologically, the tooth structures appear normal but are in excess of the standard number.","This condition is more common in males and occurs most often in the maxillary anterior region.","The mesiodens form is the most common type of hyperdontia."]},
{answer:"Hypodontia",clues:["A young female patient presents with congenitally missing specific permanent teeth.","Clinical examination reveals the presence of surrounding microdontic teeth.","Radiographs confirm the lack of development of certain teeth.","Histology would reveal missing specific tooth buds during the developmental stage.","This condition is positively correlated with microdontia and is more common in permanent dentition.","The teeth most commonly affected are the third molars, followed by the second premolars and lateral incisors."]},
{answer:"Microdontia",clues:["A patient presents with maxillary lateral incisors that are physically smaller than normal.","Clinically, the affected teeth are often referred to as 'peg laterals'.","Radiographs confirm the affected teeth are smaller than other teeth in the arch.","Histologically, the tooth structures are formed normally but are reduced in size.","This condition most commonly involves the maxillary lateral incisors.","Treatment is typically non-required, but aesthetic correction may be sought."]},
{answer:"Gemination",clues:["A child presents with an enlarged tooth in the maxillary anterior region.","Clinical tooth count reveals that the total number of teeth is normal when the abnormal tooth is counted as one.","Radiographs show a single enlarged tooth where the tooth bud attempted but failed to split during development.","Histopathology suggests the pathogenesis involves an incomplete splitting of a single tooth bud.","The enlarged crown often exhibits a crack or crevice on the facial surface.","In primary dentition, this condition may result in crowding and delayed eruption of permanent successors."]},
{answer:"Fusion",clues:["A child presents with a single enlarged tooth in the anterior mandibular region.","Clinical tooth count shows a missing tooth when the anomalous tooth is counted as one.","Radiographs confirm two adjacent tooth buds united during development.","Histopathology shows dentin confluence between the two adjacent structures.","This condition may involve both the primary or permanent dentition.","Treatment often involves extraction or cosmetic shaping of the resulting enlarged tooth."]},
{answer:"Talon Cusp",clues:["A patient is noted to have an additional cusp located on the lingual surface of a maxillary anterior tooth.","The additional cusp extends at least half the distance from the cementoenamel junction to the incisal edge.","Radiographs of the tooth usually show a pulpal extension within the additional cusp.","Histology confirms a well-delineated, extra cusp composed of enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue.","This anomaly is most common in permanent teeth, especially the maxillary lateral and central incisors.","Maxillary lesions that interfere with occlusion should be removed."]},
{answer:"Concrescence",clues:["A lesion is unexpectedly discovered during a tooth extraction procedure.","The anomaly involves two adjacent teeth in the maxillary posterior region.","Radiographs may not typically show this union, but it is found during surgical removal.","Histopathology confirms the union of two adjacent teeth by cementum alone, without confluence of the underlying dentin.","The cause of the union may be developmental or post-inflammatory.","The condition is most common in the maxillary posterior region because the roots naturally flare distally."]},
{answer:"Dilaceration",clues:["A patient presents with a severe bend or abnormal angulation in the root of an affected tooth.","Clinical exam is unremarkable as the deformity is primarily radicular.","Radiographs clearly demonstrate the abnormal curvature or bend in the root.","Histologically, the majority of cases arise after an injury that displaced the calcified portion of the tooth germ during formation.","Any tooth may be affected by this condition.","Treatment depends on the severity, but if the tooth is vital and has periodontal support, it may be left alone."]},
{answer:"Taurodontism",clues:["A patient presents with normal-appearing crowns of multirooted teeth.","Clinical features are unremarkable, and abnormalities are only visible radiographically.","Radiographically, the affected teeth are rectangular, showing an enlargement of the body and pulp chamber.","Histology reveals the apical displacement of the pulpal floor and bifurcation of the roots.","This condition occurs more frequently in permanent teeth and is often bilateral.","Treatment is generally not required, but the condition can complicate root canal therapy."]},
{answer:"Dens Invaginatus",clues:["A young patient presents with a deep surface invagination on the crown of a permanent lateral incisor.","The deep invagination is lined by enamel.","Radiographs demonstrate a dilated invagination, sometimes resembling a 'tooth within a tooth' (dens in dente).","Histologically, the defect shows a profound infolding of enamel and dentin.","This coronal form is the most common presentation and occurs more frequently in the maxilla.","The opening of the invagination should be restored to prevent cavity formation."]},
{answer:"Hypercementosis",clues:["An older adult presents with excessive deposition of cementum on the radicular surface of a single tooth.","The tooth has been subjected to abnormal occlusal trauma (constant occlusal force).","Radiographs reveal enlarged roots surrounded by a normal periodontal ligament space.","Histology confirms the non-neoplastic, excessive deposition of cellular and acellular cementum that pushes the PDL outward.","The condition is usually asymptomatic and occurs in adulthood.","If extraction is necessary, the surgical removal is difficult because the radicular portion is wider than the cervical portion."]},
{answer:"Ankylosis",clues:["A patient presents with a primary mandibular first molar that has failed to exfoliate and appears submerged.","The affected tooth's occlusal plane is below the adjacent permanent dentition.","Radiographs reveal the absence of a periodontal ligament space.","Histopathology confirms the anatomic fusion of cementum with the alveolar bone.","The condition results in the cessation of eruption after emergence.","Treatment often involves extraction and subsequent space maintenance because the tooth fails to respond to orthodontic forces."]},
{answer:"Amelogenesis Imperfecta",clues:["An inherited abnormality affecting the enamel is noted in both the primary and permanent dentition.","Clinical examination reveals soft enamel with brown pigmentation and a snow-capped appearance on incisal/occlusal surfaces.","Radiographs demonstrate that enamel cannot be detected (hypoplastic type) or is poorly mineralized.","Histopathology reveals a defect in the amount of enamel (hypoplastic) or in the removal of proteins resulting in softer enamel (hypomaturation).","If the matrix formation is normal thickness but lacks calcification, the enamel is described as soft with a 'swiss cheese' appearance.","Primary teeth require stainless steel crowns before the enamel begins breaking away."]},
{answer:"Dentinogenesis Imperfecta",clues:["The patient is noted to have hereditary developmental disturbances of the dentin.","Multiple teeth are involved, displaying a distinct gray or bluish coloration.","Radiographs show bulbous crowns, thin roots, and cervical constriction (tulip shape).","Histology would show abnormal dentin formation, although the specific cellular defects are not described in the sources.","The root canals and pulp chambers are characteristically obliterated.","Teeth are poor candidates for full crowns due to frequent cervical fractures, often necessitating full dentures or implants later in life."]},
{answer:"Radicular Dentin Dysplasia (Type I)",clues:["A patient presents with normal-looking crowns but extreme tooth mobility.","The disorder is not clinically visible and requires radiographs for diagnosis.","Radiographs of primary teeth show little or no detectable pulp and markedly short roots.","Histology reveals loss of organization of the root dentin, leading to shortened root length.","Permanent teeth may show crescent or chevron-shaped pulp chambers with pulp stones.","The condition leads to early tooth loss, and endodontic therapy has variable success due to the short roots."]},
{answer:"Coronal Dentin Dysplasia (Type II)",clues:["A child presents with primary dentition exhibiting blue/brown translucency and bulbous crowns.","The permanent teeth in the patient appear clinically normal.","Radiographs of the permanent teeth show enlarged pulp chambers with apical extensions described as thistle tube-shaped or flame-shaped.","Histopathology would confirm features similar to Dentinogenesis Imperfecta, but only in the primary dentition.","The roots are of normal length in both the primary and permanent dentition.","Meticulous oral hygiene is required, and endodontics has better success than in Type I because the roots are normal length."]},
{answer:"Turner Hypoplasia",clues:["A patient presents with white, yellow, or brown discoloration on a permanent tooth.","The permanent maxillary central incisor is affected following a traumatic injury to the overlying primary central incisor.","Radiographs would show morphological abnormality where tooth structure is missing.","Histology is defined by enamel hypoplasia caused by periapical inflammatory disease in an overlying primary tooth.","This condition most commonly affects the permanent molars in the mandible.","The discoloration is a result of damage to the successor tooth germ during development."]},
{answer:"Syphilitic Hypoplasia",clues:["A child presents with enamel hypoplasia affecting both anterior and posterior teeth.","Examination of the anterior teeth shows screwdriver-shaped crowns with constricted incisal edges (Hutchinson incisors).","Radiographs of the posterior teeth reveal a disorganized occlusal surface anatomy.","Histology confirms enamel hypoplasia caused by congenital syphilis.","The posterior teeth exhibit an anatomy resembling a mulberry (Mulberry molars).","This condition is one component of the Hutchinson triad, along with ocular keratitis and 8th nerve deafness."]},
{answer:"Erythema Migrans (Geographic Tongue)",clues:["A female patient presents complaining of a sensitive, burning sensation on her tongue when eating spicy foods.","The dorsal tongue shows multiple erythematous areas surrounded by a raised yellow-white border.","Radiographs are irrelevant as this is a soft tissue condition (oral manifestation of psoriasis).","Histology reveals collection of neutrophils in the superficial epithelium, known as Munro abscesses.","The red areas represent thin epithelium that is missing filiform papillae.","Topical steroids may be used if burning or tenderness is noted."]},
{answer:"Ankyloglossia",clues:["A child patient presents with difficulty articulating certain sounds (speech problems).","Examination shows a short lingual frenulum that limits the movement of the tongue.","Radiographs are not relevant to this soft tissue anomaly.","Histology reveals an incorrectly positioned, short lingual frenulum.","Complications may include an open bite and swallowing problems.","Treatment involves a surgical frenectomy, often deferred until after age 4–5."]},
{answer:"White Sponge Nevus",clues:["The patient has an autosomal dominant inherited condition first appearing in early childhood.","Examination reveals thick, bilateral, white folded mucosa on the buccal surfaces that does not rub off.","Radiographs are non-contributory.","Histology shows hyperparakeratosis, acanthosis, and eosinophilic condensation in the perinuclear region of the epithelial cells.","The clinical presentation will not disappear when the buccal mucosa is stretched (differentiating it from leukoedema).","Treatment is typically not required, and the prognosis is good."]},
{answer:"Cleidocranial Dysplasia",clues:["A child presents with short stature, an enlarged skull, and frontal and parietal bossing.","Examination reveals mobile shoulders due to the absence or hypoplasia of clavicles.","Radiographs confirm numerous unerupted permanent teeth and multiple supernumerary teeth.","Histopathology reveals a defect primarily involving the skull and clavicles due to an autosomal dominant trait.","Oral features include retained primary teeth and a narrow, high-arched palate.","Treatment involves extraction of primary and supernumerary teeth, followed by orthodontic extrusion of permanent teeth."]},
{answer:"Double Lip",clues:["A patient presents with a redundant mucosal fold on the upper lip.","The fold, which gives the appearance of two lips, is visible when smiling or tensing the lip.","Imaging is not required for diagnosis.","Histology confirms the presence of an extra fold of mucosal tissue.","This condition may be associated with Asher syndrome, which includes fluid enlargement of the eye (blepharochalasis).","Treatment is cosmetic surgical reduction."]},
{answer:"Fordyce Granules",clues:["An adult patient presents with multiple yellow or white papular lesions on the buccal mucosa.","The lesions are ectopic sebaceous glands found in the oral mucosa.","Radiographs are not useful for diagnosis.","Histology reveals sebaceous gland tissue located where it would not normally be found.","This common condition affects 80% of the population.","The lesions are usually asymptomatic and require no treatment."]},
{answer:"Leukoedema",clues:["A Black patient presents with edematous mucosa that is site-specific to the buccal mucosa, presenting almost always bilaterally.","Examination shows milky, opalescent gray-white folded mucosa.","Radiographs are not relevant.","Histology shows acanthosis, intracellular edema, and hyperparakeratosis.","The mucosal folding will diminish or disappear when the buccal mucosa is stretched.","This condition is more common and severe in smokers, but no treatment is required."]},
{answer:"Linea Alba",clues:["A patient presents with bilateral white lines on the buccal mucosa at the level of the occlusal plane.","The white line is caused by pressure, frictional irritation, or sucking trauma.","Imaging is irrelevant.","Histology reveals hyperorthokeratosis, which results in the white coloring, and intracellular edema.","The lines are not straight and follow the occlusal plane.","The condition is a common alteration of the buccal mucosa that may spontaneously regress without treatment."]},
{answer:"Macroglossia",clues:["A patient presents with an enlarged tongue that is causing speech difficulties and drooling.","Examination sometimes shows a crenated or scalloped lateral border due to pressure from the mandibular molars and premolars.","Radiographs may show an open bite and malocclusion resulting from the large tongue.","Histopathology findings vary depending on the underlying cause (e.g., amyloidosis, neurofibromatosis).","The enlargement may be hereditary (e.g., Down syndrome) or acquired (e.g., acromegaly, amyloidosis).","Treatment may involve a reduction glossectomy and/or speech therapy."]},
{answer:"Stafne Defect",clues:["An asymptomatic adult male presents with a concavity on the lingual surface of the mandible.","Clinical examination is unremarkable, but the lesion is found on routine imaging.","Radiographs reveal a unilocular, well-circumscribed radiolucency with corticated borders at the mandibular angle, below the mandibular canal.","Histology reveals a focal lingual mandibular bone concavity not lined by epithelium, making it a pseudocyst.","The defect is unilateral and is stable, meaning it does not change or grow.","Biopsy is generally discouraged, and no treatment is necessary if the diagnosis can be made radiographically."]},
{answer:"Lingual Thyroid",clues:["A female patient in puberty presents with a mass sensation and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).","Examination reveals a mass at the base of the tongue on the midline.","Imaging via a thyroid scan (iodine isotopes) confirms ectopic thyroid tissue.","Histology, performed with caution due to vascularity, confirms thyroid tissue.","Caused by failure of thyroid gland migration during development.","For 70% of patients, this is their only thyroid tissue; may cause hypothyroidism in 15–33% of cases."]},
{answer:"Fissured Tongue",clues:["A patient presents with asymptomatic grooves or fissures on the dorsal tongue.","Examination confirms deep grooves running across the dorsal surface.","Imaging is not relevant.","Histopathology reveals deep grooves in the mucosa.","Associated with geographic tongue, Down syndrome, and Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.","Treatment involves good hygiene with a soft toothbrush to clean debris from the fissures."]},
{answer:"Hairy Tongue",clues:["A patient with a history of heavy smoking and poor oral hygiene complains of altered taste (dysgeusia).","Examination shows elongated filiform papillae and discoloration/staining on the dorsal tongue.","Imaging is not relevant.","Histology shows prominent filiform papillae with bacteria clinging to thick keratin.","Discoloration is due to microbial colonization retaining exogenous products like smoke.","Prognosis is good; treatment involves eliminating predisposing factors and improving oral hygiene."]},
{answer:"Lingual Varicosities",clues:["An older patient presents with dilated, tortuous veins located sublingually.","Solitary lesions are asymptomatic and bluish.","Radiographs are non-contributory, though phleboliths may rarely be seen.","Histology shows dilated, thin-walled veins due to collagen loss.","Associated with aging, not cardiovascular disease or hypertension.","Treatment is typically not required, though surgical removal is an option."]},
{answer:"Exostoses",clues:["A middle-aged patient who bruxes presents with a hard bony protuberance on the cortical plate.","Examination reveals an asymptomatic, localized osseous protuberance, often on buccal or palatal surfaces.","Radiographs show an opaque mass.","Histology shows dense lamellar cortical bone.","Cause is reactive, stimulated by osteoblasts in response to stress or clenching.","Treatment usually not required unless needed for denture placement."]},
{answer:"Torus Mandibularis",clues:["A young adult male of Inuit heritage presents with hard bony growths on the lingual mandibular cortex.","Examination reveals bilateral growths, usually multiple.","Radiographs show well-defined radiopaque masses superimposed over the mandible.","Histology shows dense lamellar cortical bone.","Genetic lesions responsive to functional stress, grow slowly with age.","Treatment is elective; removal only if needed for appliance placement."]},

{answer:"Nasolabial Cyst",clues:["A 40-year-old female presents with a bulge in the upper lip lateral to the midline.","Examination reveals swelling in the labial vestibule next to the nasolabial fold.","Imaging may show a soft tissue mass not associated with bone.","Histology shows a cyst lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium, sometimes with goblet cells and cilia.","Derived from epithelium of the nasolacrimal duct.","Surgical excision is done intraorally; recurrence is rare."]},
{answer:"Nasopalatine Duct Cyst",clues:["A 55-year-old male presents with swelling and drainage in the anterior maxilla.","Located near the apex of teeth #8 and #9.","Radiographs show a well-circumscribed radiolucency at the midline anterior maxilla.","Histology shows lining varies: pseudostratified ciliated epithelium near nose, squamous near teeth.","Radiolucency may appear heart-shaped due to nasal spine superimposition.","Most common non-odontogenic cyst, arising from nasopalatine duct remnants."]},
{answer:"Dermoid Cyst",clues:["A young adult presents with slow-growing, painless midline swelling in the floor of the mouth.","Mass is doughy or rubbery, retains pitting on pressure.","Radiographs are not useful.","Histology shows orthokeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with adnexal structures (hair follicles, sebaceous glands).","Located below geniohyoid may cause 'double chin' appearance.","Treatment is surgical removal; recurrence uncommon."]},
{answer:"Oral Lymphoepithelial Cyst",clues:["A young adult presents with a small (<1 cm) submucosal mass.","Firm to soft, located in lateral floor of mouth.","Radiographs not relevant.","Histology shows cyst lined by stratified squamous epithelium with lymphoid tissue containing germinal centers.","Cyst lumen contains keratin; not found on midline (distinguishes from dermoid cyst).","May originate from obstructed tonsillar crypts or trapped salivary epithelium."]},
{answer:"Amalgam Tattoo",clues:["A patient presents with a black, blue, or gray macule on the gingiva or alveolar mucosa.","The lesion is most likely a result of implantation of amalgam into the oral mucosa following an abrasion.","Radiographs may occasionally reveal radiopaque metallic fragments within the tissue.","Histology shows silver salts of amalgam staining the reticulin fibers around nerves and blood vessels.","This lesion is asymptomatic and is not brown, differentiating it from melanin pigmentation.","A biopsy is indicated only if the lesion cannot be diagnosed clinically to rule out a melanocytic neoplasm."]},
{answer:"Linear Gingival Erythema (HIV-associated)",clues:["An HIV-positive patient presents with an asymptomatic, linear band of erythema involving the free gingival margin.","Examination shows a distinct red line along the gingival margin, possibly extending as punctuate erythema onto the alveolar mucosa.","Radiographs show no loss of periodontal attachment.","Histology would confirm inflammation localized to the free gingival margin.","This condition may represent an unusual pattern of candidiasis, appearing in 90% or more of HIV seropositive patients.","This is the least severe form of HIV periodontal disease."]},
{answer:"Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (NUG)",clues:["A patient presents with severe gingival pain, bleeding, and bad breath (halitosis).","Clinical examination shows ulceration and necrosis of one or more interdental papillae (punched-out appearance).","Radiographs show no loss of periodontal attachment.","Histopathology reveals gingival necrosis and ulceration.","The patient may have underlying systemic factors such as HIV or infectious mononucleosis.","Treatment requires debridement, povidone-iodine irrigation, and antimicrobial therapy."]},
